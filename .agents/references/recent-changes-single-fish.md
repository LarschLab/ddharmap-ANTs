# Recent Changes - Single-Fish Workflow

**Purpose:** rolling handoff log for meaningful single-fish work, remaining breakpoints, and rerun implications.

**Use this file when:** work targets `notebooks/2PF_to_HCR.ipynb` or single-fish ownership modules.

## Update template

### YYYY-MM-DD - short task label

- Slice goal:
  - owner-complete migration target for this session
- Passes completed in this session:
  - ordered sub-passes completed before stopping
- What changed:
  - concise description of the behavior, ownership, or workflow change
- What remains broken:
  - known failures, gaps, or deferred follow-up
- Remaining in-slice work:
  - cells, helpers, or functions still inside the same ownership slice
- Next likely breakpoint:
  - exact next stage, file, cell, test, or command to resume from or expected to fail next
- Rerun implications:
  - minimum rerun or validation sequence still needed after this change

## Notes

- Append new entries; do not rewrite unrelated history.
- Keep migration state in `current-state.md`; use this file for per-change single-fish handoff detail.
